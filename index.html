        <h3>Taj Mahal</h3>
        <p> "The Taj Mahal is a labor of love. Emperor Shah Jahan built it in honor of his favorite wife, 
             Mumtaz Mahal, who bore 14 children but died in labor. Jahan was lost without her, and in 1631,
             he began construction on what is probably the world's most elaborate and expensive mausoleum 
             (though the tomb itself is unadorned per Muslim law). Construction required a rumored some 
             20,000 laborers and 1,000 elephants, who hauled marble from all over the region. The Taj is 
             famously symmetrical, which is part of why it's so beautiful to look at and photograph. 
             It you go, go for sunrise before it gets overwhelmed with visitors."</p>

            <h3>Christ The Redeemer</h3>
        <p> "This iconic Christ statue is found in an equally iconic city, Rio de Janeiro. It was completed in 
             1931 (making it the newest of the new 7 wonders of the world), though a priest first proposed building
             a religious monument on Mount Corcovado almost a century earlier. While Christ is often depicted on a 
             cross, this towering, bright white figure stands 98 feet tall with its arms outstretched. Generally 
             viewed as a symbol of peace and welcoming, it's covered in thousands of small stone tiles that were 
             painstakingly applied by devout women."</p>

            <h3>Petra, Jordan</h3>
        <p>"Petra comes from the ancient Greek “Petros,” meaning “rock,” which is a boring name for a very not boring 
            place. Petra is in the south of Jordan between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea, a few hours drive from the 
            capital city, Amman, and it's believed to have been established around 300 BC."</p>

            <h3>The Great Wall of China</h3>
        <p> "The Great Wall is something of a misnomer. The wall is not actually continuous but many walls built at
             different times and for different reasons; many were joined together, but gaps still exist. Some parts .
             of the wall feel newer and almost pristine — these were built during the Ming Dynasty when the Ming 
             were at war with Mongolians around the 1300s. The older walls date back as far as 700 BC (which makes 
             it the oldest of the new 7 Wonders of the World), and these sections show their age today. Still, 
             the Great Wall weaves and winds over the hills where China borders Mongolia, measuring about 20,000 
             kilometers (12,427 miles) and crossing nine provinces."</p>

            <h3>The Colosseum</h3>
        <p>  "This beauty, though it belongs to the new 7 wonders of the world, was commissioned in Rome around 70 AD.
              The massive amphitheater has over 80 entrances and seating for at least 50,000 people. Spectators would
              come to watch gladiators battle, animals fight or be hunted, and much more. While some parts of the 
              Colosseum have crumbled — from earthquakes, looters, vandals, or fire — it's still a gorgeous sight, 
              even despite the throngs of tourists."</p>

            <h3>Machu Picchu</h3>
        <p> "Machu Picchu is one of the most impressive sites in Peru — and on the planet. Built 7,000 feet above sea level, 
             the ancient citadel dates back to the height of the Incan Empire in the 15th century. It's estimated that only
             about 750 people lived here as it was a royal estate rather than a proper city. In the native tongue, Quechua, 
             the name means “Old Peak,” but the excellently constructed site wears its age gracefully and is impressively 
             maintained."</p>

            <h3>Chichén Itzá</h3>
        <p> "Found in the Yucatán state, Chichén Itzá is a massive Mayan city that was once a powerhouse in the area. Its heyday 
             was from around 600 AD to 1200 AD, and its name translates to “at the mouth at the well of Itza.” As to what Itza is,
             it's believed to refer to an ethnic group or translate to “enchanter of the waters.” The name makes sense either way
             as the Yucatán Peninsula is famous for its underwater rivers and open freshwater sinkholes, called cenotes. Water 
             was integral to life here — and likely a factor in the city's success before its eventual, mysterious decline."</p>
